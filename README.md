# What is it?
Shardinator is an app on Android and iOs, that takes your images and videos, encrypts them locally on your device and sends them to a fast, private and secure cloud storage. It then deletes the files on your device so you have more room to store the memories that are to come!
The Shardinator uses [Storj](https://storj.io) to store your files. It is a distributes network with end-to-end encrpytion - meaning: you and only you can access your data! No one, not even from Storj can access your files!

# What does it cost?
Shardinator is free and Open Source! You only pay for the storage and bandwith you use. You get 25 GB for free if you [make an account on Storj](https://storj.io/signup)! After you've used the free quota you pay $0.004 per GiB for storing your files. If you download them again you pay $0.007 per GiB for egress bandwith - 25GB per month are free, too.

# Current state
The app is under heavy development! You may build it yourself using Visual Studio 2022 and .Net 8. Expect bugs and glitches! PR's and contributions are welcome!
